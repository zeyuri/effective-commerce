# E-Commerce Implementation Plan - Complete Guide

## Overview
This plan merges all requirements into a cohesive implementation strategy that can be executed in a focused development session. Each task builds upon the previous, creating a complete e-commerce backend with guest checkout, customer accounts, and admin functionality.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 0: Setup
0. **Development Workflow** (`/tasks/00-development-workflow.md`)
   - GitHub branch protection
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - PR templates and policies
   - Development guidelines

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. **Core Infrastructure** (`/tasks/01-core-infrastructure.md`)
   - Database setup and migrations
   - ID generation service
   - Response wrappers
   - Error types
   - Common utilities

2. **Session Management** (`/tasks/02-session-management.md`)
   - Session service
   - Cookie handling
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Session persistence

### Phase 2: Commerce Core
3. **Product Catalog** (`/tasks/03-product-catalog.md`)
   - Product schema and variants
   - Category management
   - Inventory tracking
   - Public product APIs

4. **Cart System** (`/tasks/04-cart-system.md`)
   - Cart service
   - Session-based operations
   - Cart persistence
   - Cart validation

5. **Checkout Workflow** (`/tasks/05-checkout-workflow.md`)
   - Email capture
   - Address management
   - Shipping calculation
   - Payment abstraction
   - Checkout API

6. **Order Management** (`/tasks/06-order-management.md`)
   - Order creation from cart
   - Order tracking
   - Guest order lookup
   - Order notifications

### Phase 3: User Management
7. **Customer Accounts** (`/tasks/07-customer-accounts.md`)
   - Registration/login
   - Post-checkout registration
   - Profile management
   - Cart association

8. **Authentication System** (`/tasks/08-authentication-system.md`)
   - JWT implementation
   - Multi-scope auth
   - Refresh tokens
   - Auth middleware

### Phase 4: Admin System
9. **Admin Foundation** (`/tasks/09-admin-foundation.md`)
   - Admin authentication
   - Permission system
   - Admin middleware
   - Audit logging

10. **Admin APIs** (`/tasks/10-admin-apis.md`)
    - Product management
    - Order management
    - Customer management
    - Analytics dashboard

### Phase 5: Production Ready
11. **Testing Strategy** (`/tasks/11-testing-strategy.md`)
    - Unit test setup
    - Integration tests
    - E2E test scenarios
    - Performance tests

12. **Production Features** (`/tasks/12-production-features.md`)
    - Health checks
    - Monitoring
    - Rate limiting
    - Error tracking

## Key Design Principles

1. **Effect-First**: Every service uses Effect for type safety and error handling
2. **Layer Architecture**: Clean dependency injection
3. **Session-Based**: Cart operations work without authentication
4. **Workflow Consistency**: Complex operations as Effect workflows
5. **Testable**: Every component independently testable

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Guest can browse products
- [ ] Guest can add to cart without login
- [ ] Guest can complete checkout with email only
- [ ] Guest can track order with email + order number
- [ ] Customer can create account after checkout
- [ ] Customer can view order history
- [ ] Admin can manage products
- [ ] Admin can process orders
- [ ] All endpoints respond < 200ms
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage

## Development Flow

1. Start with task 01, complete it fully
2. Run tests before moving to next task
3. Each task builds on previous ones
4. Keep services small and focused
5. Use the task files as implementation guides

Now creating individual task files...
